## B-Team Dockerized Minecraft Server
This container runs Attack of the B-Team server available from [Technic](http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/attack-of-the-bteam.552556).  
The boys wanted another B-Team server setup and I am learning how to use Docker, so win-win :)


Currently the launch.sh and server.properties files are defaults.
